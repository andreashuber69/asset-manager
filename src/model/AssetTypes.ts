 * @description It is unfortunate that this mostly duplicates the [[AssetType]] enum but it appears that there's no
 * clean way to remove the duplication, except for probably using a number-based enum instead of a string enum. However,
 * doing so would require many changes and disrupt core assumptions (like e.g. that [[Asset.type]] has the same type
 * as [[Asset.location]]), such that it doesn't currently seem to be worth the effort.
