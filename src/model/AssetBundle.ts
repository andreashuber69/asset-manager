/**
 * Defines the base of all classes that represent a bundle of assets.
 * @description Asset bundles are primarily useful in conjunction with crypto currencies, where one address can hold a
 * balance of multiple currencies. For example, a BTC address could potentially hold balances of BTC, BCH, BTG, BCD and
 * so on. A bundle of assets is always defined by a primary asset, the details of which are then used to retrieve
 * information about secondary assets. For example, in the case of Ethereum, a [[EthWallet]] object is the primary asset
 * and [[Erc20TokenWallet]] objects are the secondary assets. When the former is instantiated with an address and then
 * put into a bundle by calling [[EthWallet.bundle]], [[Erc20TokenWallet]] objects are automatically added to [[assets]]
 * for each of the ERC20 tokens with a non-zero balance and a listing on coinmarketcap.com.
 * Since every asset must reside in a bundle, there is also the class GenericAssetBundle, which never holds secondary
 * assets besides the primary one. This is used for all [[PreciousMetalAsset]] subclasses and [[CryptoWallet]]
 * subclasses where the associated addresses cannot currently have balances of more than one currency.
