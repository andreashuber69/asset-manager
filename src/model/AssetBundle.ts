/**
 * Defines the base of all classes that represent a bundle of assets.
 * @description Asset bundles are primarily useful in conjunction with crypto currencies, where one address can hold a
 * balance of multiple currencies. For example, an ETH address can hold balances of hundreds of ERC20 tokens. A bundle
 * of assets is always defined by a primary asset, the details of which are then used to retrieve information about
 * secondary assets. For example, in the case of ERC20 tokens, a [[Erc20TokensWallet]] object is the primary asset
 * and the nested [[Erc20TokenWallet]] objects are the secondary assets. When the former is instantiated with an address
 * and then put into a bundle by calling [[Erc20TokensWallet.bundle]], [[Erc20TokenWallet]] objects are automatically
 * added to [[assets]] for each of the ERC20 tokens.
 * Since every asset must reside in a bundle, there is also the class [[GenericAssetBundle]], which never holds
 * secondary assets besides the primary one. This is used for all [[PreciousMetalAsset]] subclasses and other
 * [[CryptoWallet]] subclasses.
