        // "beforeunload" handler and the documentation for the event warns that this could be the case. Therefore, the
        // only way to prevent the loss of unsaved data is to save our data either continuously or in the "beforeunload"
        // handler. We could either save through window.localStorage or download to the users hard drive (via the same
        // mechanism as when the user invokes the "Save..." menu entry). However, the latter is bound to surprise at
        // least some users and doesn't seem to work on some browsers anyway (e.g. Firefox). Our only remaining option
        // is to therefore save to local storage.
        // Obviously, just saving to local storage under one key (e.g. "assets") only works reliably if the user
        // confines herself to not ever work with the application in more than one browser window. Since we seem to have
        // no way of preventing or detecting use in multiple browser windows, the storage mechanism must ideally satisfy
        // the following requirements:
        // 1. No committed but as of yet unsaved change in any browser window is ever lost if the user closes a tab,
        //    closes the whole browser or reloads the page at any time.
        // 2. It must be trivial to regain access to unsaved changes.
        // It appears that both requirements can be satisfied with the following mechanism:
        // - Data is always saved to local storage in a "beforeunload" handler under a monotonously increasing key,
        //   which is then also stored through window.sessionStorage.
        // - When the page loads, session storage is first checked for a saved key. If one exists, data under said key
        //   is then loaded from local storage. This ensures that the same data is always displayed
        //   before and after a page reload. If session storage does not contain a key, data under the largest key is
        //   loaded from local storage.
        // - Successfully loaded data is always *deleted* from local storage immediately. This ensures that navigating
        //   to the application in additional browser windows will never load the same data in more than one browser
        //   window.
        // The above should ensure that the application can be used much like a normal desktop application. Even if the
        // application is used in multiple tabs when the browser is closed, data in said tabs will be reloaded next
        // time the user navigates to the application in the same number of tabs/windows. This is nicely complemented
        // by the fact that many browsers have an option to automatically reload all previously open tabs when the
        // browser is started.
        // Unfortunately, the beforeunload handler doesn't seem to ever be called on Android when the user closes the
        // browser, neither on Chrome, Firefox nor Edge. Luckily, at least reload works.
